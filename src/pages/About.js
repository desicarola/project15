        <h1>So, who am I? </h1>
        <p>My name is Desiree Villasmil, I'm computer engineer from Caracas Venezuela and I live with my husband and my daughter in Florida since 2018.
            I love listening to music and going to the movies. I also like to travel and see new places, especially if they have a cold climate.</p>
        
        <p>During my work experience as a developer, I have developed and delivered successful and complex web applications, APIs, 
          and mobile applications using various programming languages and frameworks such as: JavaScript. Furthermore, I have honed my skills in unit testing, debugging, and problem-solving, which enables me to write efficient, robust, and scalable codes.</p>
        <p>Apart from coding skills, I have excellent teamwork, communication, and leadership abilities. I have worked with several teams of developers, designers, and stakeholders during various projects, and I understand the importance of collaboration and communication in delivering successful projects. Moreover, I have mentored and trained junior developers, ensuring they understand the company's goals, best practices, and coding standards.</p>
        <p>At my previous job, I have contributed to developing applications that improved user experience, increased revenue, and reduced costs. I believe that my experience and expertise align with the mission and values of your company. I am eager to bring my skills, passion, and work ethics to contribute to your company's success.</p>
        <p>You can see my more detailed profile in this <a href="https:\\www.linkedin.com/in/desiree-villasmil/" target="_blank" class ="black" rel="noreferrer"> <b>link</b></a> </p>

        <p>As a curious fact, I worked in a company for 4 years where I learned about AS400 servers and the RPG programming language that is rarely used nowadays.</p>
